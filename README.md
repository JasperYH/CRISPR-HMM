# CRISPR-HMM
CRISPR-HMM is a Python package that of CRISPR sequence data with the hidden Markov model. The CRISPR-HMM model works in three steps: 1) estimate transition probability from the data with the forward-backward algorithm. 2) Perform sequence alignment with the Viterbi algorithm. 3) Quantification of CRISPR-induced mutations.

## Installation
The package can be installed with 

`pip install CRISPR-HMM`

## Tutorial
